# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The following is an outline of the Coursera Project, Week 4, Getting and Cleaning Data.  This project contains files that includes a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data titled CodeBook.md.  Run_analysis.R contains all scripts used to perfom the analysis.  

Run_analysis.R provides detailed scripts to do the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each      subject.
